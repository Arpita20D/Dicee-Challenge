# Drum kit
Welcome to my very loud, very proud, and slightly addictive Drum Kit project!  
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 


What is this?

Ever wanted to be a drummer without annoying your neighbors (too much)?  
This is a fun little web app that lets you bang on a virtual drum kit using your **keyboard keys** or **mouse clicks**.

Yes, it makes real drum sounds. No, I don't take responsibility for your groove addiction. ðŸ˜Ž



How it works

  Click the buttons or press keys (`w`, `a`, `s`, `d`, `j`, `k`, `l`) on your keyboard.
  Boom! Crash! Snare! Each key plays a sound and shows a visual animation.
  Built from scratch using:
  HTML to lay it all out
  CSS to make it look like a real-ish drum kit
  JavaScript to bring the BOOM


Tech Stack

 Vanilla HTML
 Vanilla CSS
 Vanilla JavaScript  
 Basically the vanilla ice cream of web dev.
